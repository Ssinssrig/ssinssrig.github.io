    It should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
    Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides <html>, <head>, <body>, and <title>. Using tag multiple times still counts as just one!

    Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site.

    Have at least one stylesheet file of your own creation, styles.css, which uses at least five (5) different CSS selectors (e.g. tag (example),
    class (.example), or ID (#example)), and within which you use a total of at least five (5) different CSS properties, such as font-size, or margin;

    Integrate one or more features of JavaScript into your site to make your site more interactive. For example, you can use JavaScript to add alerts,
    to have an effect at a recurring interval, or to add interactivity to buttons, dropdowns, or forms. Feel free to be creative!

                            <h2>Stop, sit down and listen to my story, young warrior</h2>
                            <hr>
                            <p>Hello, random stranger! Welcome to my website.</p>
                            <p>My name is Dawid (pronounced like David). I'm a physical therapist who also enjoys coding. This website is one of the assignments from Harvard's CS50 online course.</p>
                            <p>I'm a US immigrant from Poland currently living in NYC. I was born on March 7th in a town called Inowrocław at 11:30 PM, just 30 minutes before International Women's Day. Lucky me, I guess! If I had been born a few minutes later, my friends would've teased me with birthday roses for years!</p>
                            <p>I have a dedicated section to introduce you to my hometown, which I adore. During my primary and middle school years, I managed average grades without much studying at home. Living with ADHD, I find myself easily distracted, yet I possess the ability to hyperfocus, which helps me excel in certain areas.</p>
                            <p>I aimed for the best high schools in my town but failed to get in. I ended up at a nearby commercial technical school, earning the title of sales technician. My lack of ambition led me to prioritize friendships over my passions.</p>
                            <p>I attempted to pursue environmental engineering at Gdańsk University of Technology but failed to secure a spot due to its popularity under a government scholarship program. Instead, I found a place in ocean engineering. Despite passing advanced biology finals, I realized this field wasn't for me after a challenging math exam.</p>
                            <p>Returning to my hometown in debt, I contemplated my future. Considering medical, psychological, or IT studies, I hesitated due to the perceived oversaturation of IT specialists. This misconception significantly influenced my decision to pursue a medical profession.</p>
                            <p>However, the daunting prospect of endless education and specializations in becoming a Medical Doctor led me to explore physical therapy, known for its decent pay in the US. Thus, I formulated a master plan.</p>
                            <p>During part-time studies in Poznań, I juggled working from Monday to Friday to pay tuition, alongside studying from Friday afternoon to Sunday evening. Surviving this lifestyle meant sleeping at friends' places, babysitting for accommodation, or staying in shelters. It was tougher than I anticipated.</p>
                            <p>In my second year, I joined the ERASMUS student exchange program, spending enriching months in Turkey at Abant İzzet Baysal Üniversitesi. It was a memorable experience in a truly beautiful country.</p>
                            <p>Graduating with a bachelor's degree from the College of Education and Therapy, followed by a Master's in physical therapy from E. Piasecki Academy of Physical Education, I found myself holding a US green card.</p>
                            <p>To maintain my residency status, I emigrated to the US, where I had a whirlwind wedding within two weeks to be with my beloved girlfriend. In 2017, I arrived in NYC, kickstarting my career as a Physical Therapist Aide while pursuing the National Physical Therapy Exam. Passing this exam was the toughest challenge yet, but I succeeded and became a licensed Physical Therapist.</p>
                            <p>Amidst my achievements, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, delaying my reunion with my wife and eventually leading to our divorce. Subsequent years were marked by lonely attempts to find a romantic partner or friends, proving more challenging than I anticipated.</p>
                            <p>Realizing the limited financial prospects in the physical therapy field in Poland, I resolved to become a programmer. My goal is to find remote work in the US as a programmer, allowing me to be close to family and friends while increasing the chances of finding a soulmate.</p>
                            <p>So here I am now, ready to conquer programming and rediscover my happiness! Fingers crossed!</p>
